                The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a non-profit organization that stands for animal ethics. 
                Founded in 1884 the AKC has created a set of standards for all purebred breeds that showcase the dogs strengths and health. 
                Although AKC registration is not a requirement for dogs unless they plan to compete in shows or animal sports, we still maintain and achieve the AKC standard for the health of the breed.

                All of our dogs are certified as being purebred bulldogs for the benefit of the animal. 
                Purebred animals are less prone to medical conditions or complications, and when bred to the AKC standard, are given the best quality of life.

                Along with bulldog's velvet wrinkles they are very affectionate dogs, they love attention and pets. 
                While the AKC describes bulldogs as being friendly, couragous, and calm dogs; they can also be vigilant and protective of their owners. 
                I would say bulldogs can be somewhere in the middle when it comes to energy levels, they love to sleep but will also play hard. 
                With that energy it's important to note that they will need some extra mental stimulation to keep out of trouble.
                It would be smart to have some toys that require attention and focus to keep them busy.
